# GWT Project Structure

In a Google Web Toolkit (GWT) project, the organization of code is often divided into three main directories:

## 1. Client Directory:

The `client` directory houses the client-side code, which is the code that runs in the user's browser. Here, developers write GWT client-side code in Java, which will later be compiled into JavaScript by the GWT compiler. The `client` directory typically contains user interface components, event handlers, and other functionality specific to the client side.

## 2. Server Directory:

Conversely, the `server` directory contains the server-side code responsible for handling business logic, managing data, and responding to client requests. This code is often written in Java or another server-side language. Although GWT is primarily focused on client-side development, Java can be used on the server side. The `server` directory may include components that interact with client-side code through mechanisms like RPC (Remote Procedure Call).

## 3. Shared Directory:

The `shared` directory is intended for code that needs to be shared between the client and server sides of the application. This may include Java classes or other resources common to both components. Code placed in the `shared` directory should avoid dependencies on browser-specific or server-specific functionality and should be designed to run seamlessly on both the client and server.

The separation of client, server, and shared code in distinct directories helps maintain a clear and organized project structure.
