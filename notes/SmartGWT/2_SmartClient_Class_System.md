# SmartClient Class Structure Hierarchy

## Overview

SmartClient is a powerful JavaScript framework for building rich web applications. Its class structure is organized hierarchically to provide a modular and extensible architecture.

## `ClassFactory`

### Purpose
- The `ClassFactory` class is responsible for creating instances of SmartClient classes. It is the entry point for dynamically creating objects based on class names.

## `Class`

### Purpose
- The `Class` class is the base class for all SmartClient classes. It provides essential methods for class definition, inheritance, and instantiation.

## Core Classes

### `Canvas`

#### Purpose
- The `Canvas` class is a fundamental class representing a graphical user interface (GUI) component. It serves as the base class for various visual elements in SmartClient.

### `FormItem`

#### Purpose
- The `FormItem` class is a subclass of `Canvas` that represents form input items. It provides a foundation for creating form fields, checkboxes, and other input elements.

## Data Classes

### `DataSource`

#### Purpose
- The `DataSource` class facilitates data binding between the client and server. It defines the structure of data, operations for data retrieval and manipulation, and integrates with various data sources.

### `ResultSet`

#### Purpose
- The `ResultSet` class represents a set of records returned from a data source. It provides methods for handling and manipulating data retrieved from a server-side operation.

## Layout Classes

### `Layout`

#### Purpose
- The `Layout` class is the base class for containers that organize and manage the layout of child components. It provides a flexible structure for arranging GUI elements.

### `HLayout` and `VLayout`

#### Purpose
- The `HLayout` and `VLayout` classes extend the `Layout` class to provide horizontal and vertical layout capabilities, respectively. They are commonly used for arranging components in rows or columns.

## Usage Example

```javascript
// Creating an instance of Canvas
var myCanvas = isc.Canvas.create();

// Defining a custom DataSource
var myDataSource = isc.DataSource.create({
    ID: "myDataSource",
    dataURL: "myData.json"
});

// Creating a FormItem
var myFormItem = isc.FormItem.create({
    title: "Username",
    type: "text"
});
```

This file provides an overview of the SmartClient class structure hierarchy, highlighting key classes such as `Canvas`, `FormItem`, `DataSource`, `ResultSet`, `Layout`, `HLayout`, and `VLayout`. The example includes a brief description of each class and a simple usage example. Refer to the official SmartClient documentation for in-depth details on each class and their properties/methods.

Below is an example description of the SmartClient class `System` :

# SmartClient Class: `System`

## Description

The `System` class in SmartClient is a fundamental class that provides utility methods and properties related to the system and environment.

## Properties

### 1. `isomorphicDir`
- **Type:** String
- **Description:** Represents the path to the "isomorphic" directory where SmartClient modules are located.

### 2. `skinDir`
- **Type:** String
- **Description:** Represents the path to the directory containing the skin files for the current theme.

## Methods

### 1. `fireLoaded`
- **Description:** Fires the 'loaded' event, indicating that the SmartClient system is fully loaded.

### 2. `fireStartup`
- **Description:** Fires the 'startup' event, indicating that the SmartClient system has started up.

### 3. `getSkinDir`
- **Returns:** String
- **Description:** Retrieves the path to the skin directory for the specified skin.

### 4. `setSkinDir`
- **Parameters:**
  - `skinDir` (String): The path to the skin directory.
- **Description:** Sets the path to the skin directory for the current theme.

## Events

### 1. `loaded`
- **Description:** Fired when the SmartClient system is fully loaded.

### 2. `startup`
- **Description:** Fired when the SmartClient system has started up.

## Usage Example

```javascript
// Accessing the isomorphic directory
var isomorphicPath = isc.System.isomorphicDir;

// Retrieving the skin directory for the current theme
var currentSkinDir = isc.System.getSkinDir();

// Setting a custom skin directory
isc.System.setSkinDir("/path/to/custom/skin");
```

## Notes

- The `System` class is often used to retrieve information about the SmartClient environment, such as the paths to necessary directories.
- It provides events like 'loaded' and 'startup' that can be used for handling system initialization.
