# Branding in Smart GWT

Branding is an essential aspect of creating a distinctive and cohesive user experience in your Smart GWT application. Smart GWT provides several ways to customize the look and feel, ensuring that your application reflects your organization's brand identity.

## 1. **Theming with CSS**

### Purpose:
Smart GWT allows you to apply custom styles and themes to your application using Cascading Style Sheets (CSS). This includes modifying colors, fonts, and other visual elements.

### Example:
```css
/* Custom styling for a button */
.myCustomButton {
    background-color: #3498db;
    color: #ffffff;
    font-size: 14px;
    /* Add more styles as needed */
}
```

```java
IButton myButton = new IButton("Click me");
myButton.setStyleName("myCustomButton");
```

## 2. **Customizing Icons**

### Purpose:
Replace default icons with custom icons that match your branding. Smart GWT supports various image formats for icons.

### Example:
```java
myButton.setIcon("custom/icon.png");
```

## 3. **Logo Integration**

### Purpose:
Integrate your organization's logo into the application header or any other relevant areas.

### Example:
```xml
<HeaderLayout>
    <HLayout align="center" height="50">
        <Img src="myLogo.png" width="150" height="50" />
    </HLayout>
</HeaderLayout>
```

## 4. **Global Styling with SC class**

### Purpose:
The `SC` (SmartClient) class provides methods for global styling and theming.

### Example:
```java
SC.setStyleAttribute("body", "background-color", "#f2f2f2");
```

## 5. **Custom Skins**

### Purpose:
Create custom skins to define a consistent visual style for various components.

### Example:
```java
Canvas.setGlobalSkin("myCustomSkin");
```

## Conclusion

Branding in Smart GWT involves applying custom styles, icons, logos, and skins to create a unique and branded user interface. By leveraging CSS, custom images, and Smart GWT's theming capabilities, you can ensure that your application aligns with your organization's branding guidelines.
