# Event Handling in Smart GWT

Event handling is a crucial aspect of Smart GWT development, allowing you to respond to user interactions and system events in your web application. Smart GWT provides a comprehensive set of events that you can leverage to create dynamic and responsive user interfaces.

## 1. **Introduction to Event Handling**

In Smart GWT, events represent various interactions, such as mouse clicks, keyboard inputs, data changes, and more. Event handling involves defining callback methods that are executed in response to specific events.

## 2. **Handling Click Events**

### Purpose:
Respond to user clicks on components like buttons, list items, or any interactive elements.

### Example:
```java
IButton myButton = new IButton("Click me");
myButton.addClickHandler(new ClickHandler() {
    @Override
    public void onClick(ClickEvent event) {
        // Handle button click
        SC.say("Button clicked!");
    }
});
```

## 3. **Handling Data Events**

### Purpose:
React to changes in data, such as when records are added, updated, or removed.

### Example:
```java
dataSource.addDataChangedHandler(new DataChangedHandler() {
    @Override
    public void onDataChanged(DataChangedEvent event) {
        // Handle data changes
        SC.say("Data changed!");
    }
});
```

## 4. **Handling Selection Events**

### Purpose:
Respond to changes in the selection of records in components like `ListGrid` or `TreeGrid`.

### Example:
```java
listGrid.addSelectionChangedHandler(new SelectionChangedHandler() {
    @Override
    public void onSelectionChanged(SelectionEvent event) {
        Record selectedRecord = listGrid.getSelectedRecord();
        // Handle record selection
        SC.say("Selected: " + selectedRecord.getAttribute("name"));
    }
});
```

## 5. **Handling Keyboard Events**

### Purpose:
Capture keyboard inputs to trigger actions or navigate within your application.

### Example:
```java
form.addKeyPressHandler(new KeyPressHandler() {
    @Override
    public void onKeyPress(KeyPressEvent event) {
        if (KeyNames.ENTER.equals(event.getKeyName())) {
            // Handle Enter key press
            SC.say("Enter key pressed!");
        }
    }
});
```

## 6. **Handling Drag and Drop Events**

### Purpose:
Implement drag-and-drop functionality by responding to drag start, drag move, and drag stop events.

### Example:
```java
Canvas draggableCanvas = new Canvas();
draggableCanvas.setCanDragReposition(true);
draggableCanvas.setDragRepositionStartHandler(new DragRepositionStartHandler() {
    @Override
    public void onDragRepositionStart(DragRepositionStartEvent event) {
        // Handle drag start
        SC.say("Drag started!");
    }
});
```

## Conclusion

Event handling is an integral part of creating dynamic and interactive Smart GWT applications. By leveraging the rich set of events provided by Smart GWT, you can respond to user interactions and system events effectively.
