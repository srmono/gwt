# Smart GWT Developer Tools and Examples

Smart GWT doesn't have a specific set of "developer tools" in the way that some frameworks provide dedicated tools for development. Instead, Smart GWT leverages standard web development tools and practices. Below are examples of tools commonly used in Smart GWT development along with relevant examples:

---

## 1. **Browser Developer Tools**

### Purpose:
Browser Developer Tools, such as those in Chrome or Firefox, are essential for inspecting and debugging your Smart GWT application. They allow you to examine the DOM, inspect network requests, and debug JavaScript.

### Example:
Open Chrome DevTools by right-clicking on your Smart GWT application and selecting "Inspect". Use the "Elements" tab to inspect the DOM structure and the "Console" tab for JavaScript debugging.

## 2. **GWT Development Mode**

### Purpose:
If you are using GWT with Smart GWT, GWT Development Mode allows you to debug your client-side Java code in a hosted mode browser.

### Example:
1. Run your application in GWT Development Mode:
   ```bash
   ant devmode
   ```
2. Open your browser and navigate to `http://127.0.0.1:8888/YourApp.html`.

## 3. **Smart GWT Developer Console**

### Purpose:
Smart GWT provides a developer console that allows you to interact with the Smart GWT API and execute JavaScript commands.

### Example:
1. Open your Smart GWT application in the browser.
2. Press `Ctrl + Alt + J` to open the Smart GWT Developer Console.
3. Execute Smart GWT API commands, e.g.:
   ```javascript
   isc.say("Hello, Smart GWT!");
   ```

## 4. **Logging and Debugging Smart GWT Code**

### Purpose:
Leverage standard JavaScript logging and debugging techniques to understand and fix issues in your Smart GWT code.

### Example:
```javascript
// Logging
console.log("This is a log message");
console.warn("This is a warning message");
console.error("This is an error message");

// Debugging
debugger; // Add this line to pause execution and start debugging in the browser's Developer Tools.
```

## 5. **Smart GWT Showcase**

### Purpose:
The Smart GWT Showcase is an invaluable resource for learning and exploring different components and features provided by Smart GWT.

### Example:
Visit the [Smart GWT Showcase](https://www.smartclient.com/smartgwt/showcase/) to see live examples and view the corresponding source code.
