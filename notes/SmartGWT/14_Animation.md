# Animation in Smart GWT

Adding animations to your Smart GWT application can enhance the user experience by providing smooth transitions and visual feedback. Smart GWT offers built-in features and capabilities to easily incorporate animations into your web application.

## 1. **Built-in Animations**

### Purpose:
Smart GWT provides a set of built-in animations for common UI components.

### Example:
```java
Layout layout = new Layout();
layout.animateShow(AnimationEffect.FADE);
```

## 2. **Custom Animations with JavaScript**

### Purpose:
Create custom animations using JavaScript to achieve specific effects.

### Example:
```java
Canvas canvas = new Canvas();
canvas.animateMove(100, 100);
```

## 3. **Animating Components**

### Purpose:
Animate the movement, resizing, or visibility of UI components.

### Example:
```java
Window window = new Window();
window.animateMove(200, 200);
window.animateResize(400, 300);
```

## 4. **Sequential Animations**

### Purpose:
Execute a sequence of animations in a specific order.

### Example:
```java
Canvas canvas = new Canvas();
canvas.animateMove(100, 100).animateResize(200, 200);
```

## 5. **Easing Functions**

### Purpose:
Apply easing functions to customize the acceleration and deceleration of animations.

### Example:
```java
Canvas canvas = new Canvas();
canvas.animateMove(100, 100, new Easing(EasingFunction.ELASTIC_OUT));
```

## 6. **Event Handling with Animations**

### Purpose:
Handle events triggered by animations, such as completion or interruption.

### Example:
```java
Canvas canvas = new Canvas();
Animation animation = canvas.animateMove(200, 200);
animation.addAnimationCallback(new AnimationCallback() {
    @Override
    public void execute(boolean earlyFinish) {
        // Handle animation completion
    }
});
```

## 7. **Animation Configuration**

### Purpose:
Configure animation parameters such as duration, delay, and effect.

### Example:
```java
Canvas canvas = new Canvas();
canvas.animateMove(200, 200, new AnimationConfig(500, 0, AnimationEffect.BOUNCE_OUT));
```

## Conclusion

Adding animations to your Smart GWT application can significantly improve the user experience and make your application more engaging. Whether using built-in animations or creating custom effects, Smart GWT provides a flexible and powerful framework for incorporating animations seamlessly.
