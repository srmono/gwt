# GWT vs. Smart GWT

## 1. Base Framework

- **GWT (Google Web Toolkit):** GWT is an open-source web development toolkit developed by Google. It allows developers to write client-side code in Java, which is then compiled into JavaScript that can run in a web browser.
  
- **Smart GWT:** Smart GWT is a framework built on top of GWT. It provides additional features and components to simplify the development of rich internet applications (RIAs). Smart GWT extends GWT with a set of pre-built widgets and a data management framework.

## 2. Widget Set

- **GWT:** GWT provides a basic set of UI widgets for building web applications. Developers can use these widgets and create custom widgets as needed.
  
- **Smart GWT:** Smart GWT includes a more extensive set of pre-built widgets compared to GWT. These widgets are designed to be highly customizable and offer a rich set of features out of the box.

## 3. Data Management

- **GWT:** GWT does not have a built-in data management framework. Developers often need to use third-party libraries or implement their own data management solutions.
  
- **Smart GWT:** Smart GWT includes a powerful data management framework that simplifies working with data in web applications. It provides components for data binding, data paging, sorting, and filtering.

## 4. Ease of Use

- **GWT:** GWT requires developers to write client-side code in Java, which is then compiled into JavaScript. Some developers find this approach more challenging, especially if they are more comfortable with other web development languages like JavaScript.
  
- **Smart GWT:** Smart GWT aims to simplify the development process by providing a rich set of pre-built components and a data management framework. This can make it easier for developers to create feature-rich web applications with less code.

## 5. Community and Support

- **GWT:** GWT has been around for a longer time and has a larger community. It has been used in various projects, and there are many resources and third-party libraries available.
  
- **Smart GWT:** Smart GWT has a smaller community compared to GWT, and its adoption may not be as widespread. However, it benefits from the GWT community as it is built on top of GWT.
